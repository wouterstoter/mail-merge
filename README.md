# Mail Merge
Create mass emails using GMail, Google Sheets and Google App Script, with variables and advanced scripting options

## Use case

## Setup
The easiest way to setup the system is by copying [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boihzJ4OGOHytMMEi9k6nDC4EFIOD96UzFYxVGtGuPc/copy). If you do not want to do that, you can also create an empty spreadsheet and click 'Extensions > App Script'. Now you can copy the contents of the file Code.gs into the script, and you're ready to go.

## Authorization
The first time you use the script in a new document you need to authorize the script. This gives it permission to do the things in your Google Account it needs to do. The first time you try to use any of the options, you'll get a popup, telling you to authorize it.
